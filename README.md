# Landing Page with Form

Imagine you work for DataRobot and a request has just come in to create a landing page that is needed for a middle size marketing campaign. We want to collect user data through a form which will later be used for event registration.

The main task is to code a simple page with a form that will submit data to test endpoint

- The page layout should be accurate correspond to a sketch or .psd file
- The page should submit (POST) data to http://httpbin.org/post in a correct format.
- You are free to use any tools and materials which can help you accomplish the task faster
- You can use jQuery
- Would be nice if you count how much time you spent on this task
- You should deliver a github repository link as a result

Bonus

- The form should have a basic JS-based validation that does not allow empty fields and non-valid email format
- In addition to plain html version create a WordPress ‘page’ template for this page
